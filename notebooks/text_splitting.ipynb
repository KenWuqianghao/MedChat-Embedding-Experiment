Other as-sociations described include CHARGE, PHAVER, andSCHISIS associations and Goldenhar syndrome [Chit-tmittrapap et al., 1989; Powell et al., 1993; Sutphen etal., 1995; Tellier et al., 1998]. OA often occurs in thepresence of a number of chromosomal anomalies, inparticular trisomy 18 and 21 [Benady and Harris,1969; Harris et al., 1995; Torfs et al., 1995; Beasley etal., 1997]. Children with OA frequently have additionalmedical problems following successful surgical repairof the primary malformation. Recurrent respiratory in-fections [Dudley and Phelan, 1976; Checuti and Phe-lan, 1993b], swallowing difficulties [Smith and Beck,1985; Checuti and Phelan, 1993a] and intractable gas-tro-oesophageal reflux [Ashcraft et al., 1977; Parker etal., 1979; Jolley et al., 1980] are common causes of mor-bidity.\\nOA/ TOF may represent part of a spectrum of disor-', 'OA/ TOF may represent part of a spectrum of disor-\\nders resulting from the additive effects of genetic andpossibly environmental factors. Mild phenotypes maybe responsible for the related medical problems in theabsence of an overt malformation (for example, swal-lowing difficulties in the presence of an intact oesopha-gus), or other less-severe malformations associatedwith OA such as mild cardiac, thumb, renal, and ver-tebral anomalies. The severe end of the spectrumwould be the full VACTERL association with a largenumber of related medical problems. If this hypothesisis correct, then one would expect that the occurrence ofsuch anomalies and related medical problems wouldbe higher in the relatives of individuals with anyVACTERL component.\\nThe aim of this study is two-fold: Firstly, it investi-\\ngates the association of other defects and related medi-cal problems in OA cases and the control individuals,and secondly, it attempts to determine the occurrenceof related malformations and medical problems in thefirst-degree and more distant relatives of individualswith any VACTERL component.\\nThe process of data collection used in this study fo-\\ncuses on the whole family, in contrast to the medicalnotes and malformation registry entries used in previ-ous studies, which deal primarily with data pertainingto the affected individual.\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nThe data were collected in the form of a case-control', 'MATERIALS AND METHODS\\nThe data were collected in the form of a case-control\\npostal questionnaire over the period spanning August1997 and June 1998. The study families (“OA families”)are all either members of TOFS, a charitable supportgroup based in the United Kingdom, or KEKS, a sisterorganisation based in Germany. The OA family is de-fined as the family of a child with OA with or withoutTOF. Each family received an explanatory letter and aquestionnaire. In total 1,700 families were contacted,and 579 responded (response rate 34%).\\nThe control group comprises families with at least\\none child of a similar age and from the same geographi-cal area as the OA case. The OA families were asked toselect up to three additional families, which fulfilledthose two criteria. Out of 4,962 control questionnaires\\nsent out 1,031 were completed (response rate 21%). Theaverage number of control individuals per OA familywas 1.8.\\nInformation obtained from the questionnaires in-\\ncluded:']\n",

Although disturbances of\\nsweating and salivation were specifically queried in thequestionnaire, very few respondents admitted to theseproblems.\\nThe incidences of coincident anomalies and related\\nmedical defects are very similar when isolated and as-sociated cases of OA are compared. This indicates thatisolated OA may represent one end of the spectrum ofmalformation combinations, the other extreme beingthe full spectrum of VACTERL anomalies with addi-tional features such as sacral agenesis.\\nA number of families have two or more members\\nwith OA/TOF. In addition, McMullen et al. [1996] re-ported the incidence of VACTERL-like anomalies insibs and offspring of OA cases as being 1.4% and 4.8%,respectively.\\nThis suggests a probable genetic influence in the', 'This suggests a probable genetic influence in the\\ngenesis of OA/TOF. The condition is likely to be poly-genic rather than arising from mutations in a singlegene. The existence of a spectrum of associated anoma-lies combined with the finding that OA does occur infamilies leads to interest in the incidence of theseanomalies in other family members. Some VACTERLanomalies are either life threatening and thereforeguaranteed to have been diagnosed (e.g., OA/TOF andcardiac defects), or visible such as severe vertebral andradial ray defects. However, defects including renaland mild rib and vertebral anomalies may well go un-detected. As a massive screening program would not beethically acceptable, the true incidence of these anoma-lies in the relatives will remain unknown. This repre-sents a major limiting factor in a study of this nature.Similarly, the related medical problems describedabove may be over- or under-diagnosed. The question-naires rely on information from the children’s parents,and whereas to one parent a bad cold with a cough iscounted as a chest infection, another may reserve thisterm to describe an illness requiring hospital admis-sion. Gastro-oesophageal reflux is another conditionwhich is unreliably reported. In this case the reasonstems more from the fact that the symptoms of heart-burn and acid brash correlate poorly with pH manom-etry and other objective measurements [Parker et al.,1979; Orenstein et al., 1996].\\nAnother factor to consider is that a family with a', 'Another factor to consider is that a family with a\\nchild with multiple medical problems will be moreaware of similar symptoms in other relatives and maytherefore over-report such symptoms. This is particu-larly true in the case of second- or greater-degree rela-tives. Bearing these caveats in mind, the results of thisstudy are indicative of a higher than expected inci-dence of related medical problems in the first-degreerelatives, although the incidence of associated malfor-mations is no different than in the control group. Fami-lies with numerous members experiencing relatedmedical problems may well prove to be interesting can-didates for linkage analysis in an attempt to unravelthe genetics of OA/TOF.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nThe authors thank TOFS (Tracheo-Oesophageal Fis-\\ntula Support Group), Nottingham, UK, and KEKS e.V.(Kreis fu ¨ r Eltern von Kindern mit Speisero ¨hrenmißbil-\\ndungen), Stuttgart, Germany, for assistance, financialsupport, and access to their database, and Robin Dick-inson for helpful comments and technical assistance.S.J.W. is funded by the Wellcome Trust.\\nREFERENCES\\nAshcraft KW, Goodwin C, Amoury RA, Holder TM. 1977.

Neural tube defects, cleft lip and palate,and cardiac abnormalities are some of the most com-mon. There is now substantial evidence that pericon-ceptual folic acid will reduce the incidence of neuraltube defects by more than 50% and may also decreasethe incidence of other malformations.\\nRegulations recently enacted by the Food and Drug\\nAdministration (FDA) will require the fortification ofenriched grain foods with folic acid, starting sometimein 1998. While this is a step forward, the actual amountadded may be insufficient to protect future children.\\nThe American College of Medical Genetics strongly\\nsupports the FDA’s action. However, in addition, it rec-ommends the following:']\n",

More than 70% of the patients wereabove 40 years (mean age 44.8 years). Until recently,only male residents had been admitted to the institute,explaining why only four females participated in thisstudy. All patients were first selected according to theirclinical phenotype. Chromosome studies could be per-formed in 87 of the 96 patients, and the clinical diag-nosis of trisomy 21 was confirmed in all these patients.A full trisomy 21 was found in 86.2% of the patients, incontrast to the general findings in the literature (94%)[Evers-Kiebooms et al., 1982]. In the present study,12.6% of the patients had mosaic trisomy 21, which ishigher than the 2.4% found in the overall Down syn-drome population studies. This higher percentage ofmosaic trisomy 21 in this older population may be dueto the fact that patients with milder clinical phenotype,as seen in trisomy 21 mosaicism, reach an older age. Inone mosaic patient, an apparently balanced autosomalreciprocal translocation t(11;17)(q13;q25) was present\\nTABLE IV.

As far as we know, no other patient with trisomy21 mosaicism and a de novo autosomal reciprocaltranslocation in the normal cell line has been reportedso far. In one other mosaic patient, chromosomal analy-sis showed a mosaic pattern of double aneuploidy: 45X/46,X,+21/47,XY,+21 (79/2/19) in cultured peripherallymphocytes and a different mosaic pattern 45,X/47,XY,+21 (36/14) in cultured fibroblasts. This patienthas previously been reported [Van Buggenhout et al.,1994]. He presented a mixed phenotype with DS fea-tures (mild mental retardation, brachycephaly, upwardslanting palpebral fissures, flat midface, and shortstature) as well as features of Ullrich-Turner syndrome(short and broad neck, low posterior hairline, wide tho-rax, large internipple distance, and short stature).\\nMental Function\\nMore than 80% of the patients were moderately or\\nseverely mentally retarded. In the 50−59 year agegroup, 60% of the patients were moderately and 40%severely to profoundly mentally retarded, whereas at40−49 years, 66% of the patients were severely andonly one-third moderately mentally retarded.\\nSome studies indicated that patients with trisomy 21\\nmosaicism have better cognitive function [Fishler andKoch, 1991]. In the present study, this observationcould not be confirmed since 4/11 patients were mod-erately and 5/11 patients severely mentally retarded.\\nDementia\\nPrevious studies [Warren et al., 1989; Evenhuis et', 'Dementia\\nPrevious studies [Warren et al., 1989; Evenhuis et\\nal., 1991; Pueschel et al., 1995] have extensively docu-mented the high prevalence of dementia and Alzhei-mer’s disease in DS, which affects more than 25% ofindividuals above the age of 50 years. The neuropath-ological findings [Norman et al., 1995] of senile plaquesand deposition of amyloid protein in DS patients 20–30years earlier than in a population without DS may berelated to the increased dosage of a gene for the amy-\\nloid precursor protein on the proximal 21q region [Nor-man et al., 1995]. The overall percentage of trisomy 21patients with dementia in the present study is high(18.75%) and significantly increases with age. Nosymptoms of dementia were noted in the 24 patientsyounger than 39 years, but symptoms were noted in11.1% of the patients in the age group 40–49 years andin 42.4% of the patients in the age group 50–59 years.This high percentage of dementia cannot be explainedby selective admission of DS patients with dementia. Inthis institute, all residents have been admitted asyoung adolescents for lifelong care. There was no cor-relation between the dementia and the level of mentalretardation (Chi-square in contingency table (2 × 3); P']\n",

However, dementia was not correlated withthe level of mental retardation.\\nIn DS patients, a high prevalence of seizures has\\nbeen noted in the third decade of life [Pueschel et al.,1995] and at an older age, seizure disorders were usu-ally associated with Alzheimer’s disease [Pueschel etal., 1995].

Ourpercentages are comparable to previous reports[Pueschel and Pezzullo, 1985; Kinnell et al., 1987;Friedman et al., 1989; Dinani and Carpenter, 1990]. Inan overview of the literature, Evenhuis [1991] reporteda variation of 2.5−17% of hypothyroidism in patientswith DS, with a prevalence below 5% under the age of20 years.\\nSubclinical hypothyroidism is widely used to de-\\nscribe patients with increased TSH and normal T4,without symptoms of hypothyroidism [Anonymous,1986]. In the present study, 41 patients were diagnosedwith subclinical hypothyroidism and 10 patients weretreated. Smink et al. [1992] reported ten patients withDS and observed that TSH was increased in four pa-tients. In a group of 105 children with DS between theages of 3 months to 20 years, Alembik et al. [1996]demonstrated that one-half of these children had anincreased TSH, which improved after thyroxin treat-ment. The main argument to support treatment ofthese patients is that it may prevent progression tohypothyroidism and that improved physical and men-tal well-being is reported [Anonymous, 1986; Cooper etal., 1984]. Therefore, annual screening of T4, TSH, andthyroid antibodies is recommended to identify thosewho have a thyroid disorder.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe findings of the present study confirm the neces-', 'CONCLUSION\\nThe findings of the present study confirm the neces-\\nsity of regular screening in institutionalized older maleadults with DS syndrome to diagnose early onset de-mentia, epilepsy, hypothyroidism, and early loss of vi-sual acuity and hearing. Cytogenetic studies are nec-essary to confirm the clinical diagnosis. Special atten-tion and care should be given to the subgroups oftrisomy 21 patients with severe to profound mentalretardation, as these complications lead to serious ad-ditional limitations of functioning.

Prior to themeeting, committees were organized for each of thetraining areas, and the committee chairs presentedtheir initial drafts of the training guidelines for eachdiscipline for discussion and debate.

In responseto changes occurring in genetics training programs ac-credited by the ABMG (Ph.D.) and the AccreditationCouncil of Graduate Medical Education (M.D.), medicalgenetics training program directors have explored theneed to establish a working group to address the needsof this group that are separate and distinct from anyother existing group. The ABMG sponsors a programdirectors meeting each year, but the focus of that meet-ing is to discuss items that the Board wants to bring tothe attention of the Program Directors. The APHMGhas encouraged the Program Directors to come to-gether to address issues of common interest.

Twelve institutions have returned com- \\npleted applications for medical genetics residency pro- \\ngrams which have been processed; 10 of these are 2- \\nyear (i.e., fellowship) training programs only. Ten \\nprograms have been granted provisional accreditation; \\nnone have been site-visited yet. Two 4-year residency \\nprograms have been approved. \\nThe Medical Genetics RRC will maintain minimal re- \\nquirements but will not be “cutting edge.” A newsletter \\nis planned for program directors, with proposals for \\nchanges in requirements. The RRCs are not charged \\nwith manpower needs assessments. \\nBob Desnick summarized the Medical Genetics Res- \\nidency Training Program that has been established \\nat the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. The first year \\nof training in clinical genetics (CGY-1) includes rota- \\ntions in general pediatrics (6 months), pediatric \\nand neonatal intensive-care units (3 months), term \\nnursery (1 month), pediatric neurology (1 month), and \\npediatric emergency room (1 month). CGY-2 includes \\npediatric ward chief (3 months), pediatric and neonatal \\nintensive care units (2 months), fetal assessment \\n(1 month), and various pediatric and adult specialty \\nrotations (6 months). CGY-3 and CGY-4 include clinical \\ngenetics (7 months), biochemical genetics (5 months), \\ncytogenetics (2 months), molecular genetics (2 \\nmonths), pathology (1 month), developmental pedi- \\natrics (1 month), and 6 months of electives or research.', 'cytogenetics (2 months), molecular genetics (2 \\nmonths), pathology (1 month), developmental pedi- \\natrics (1 month), and 6 months of electives or research. \\nTrainees attend lectures, journal clubs, conferences, \\nand seminars. The program will accept two CGY-1 \\nresidents per year; the faculty includes 12 M.D. and \\nseven Ph.D. geneticists. \\nJewel1 Ward summarized the effect that managed \\ncare has had on funding of graduate medical educa- \\ntion in Tennessee. In the past, graduate medical \\neducation funding flowed from Medicare and Medicaid \\nto hospitals. On January 1, 1994, Tennessee abruptly \\nbegan a “TennCare” program through multiple \\nmanaged-care organizations (MCOs) to replace Medic- \\naid for the state. Continuance of training funding was \\nnot required of MCOs by the state. The major univer- \\nsity medical centers formed their own MCOs, but due \\nto inequality in assignment of patients and lack of \\nstate oversight of marketing practices, these MCOs \\nhave a minority of covered lives. On January 1, 1995, \\na shortfall in funds was announced, and it was stated \\nthat funds for training were no longer available out- \\nside of those allocated to MCOs. Every graduate med- \\nical education program in the state was affected by \\nthis decision, but the large programs with a dispro- \\nportionate share of TennCare patients, i.e., the large \\nmetropolitan public-service hospitals, were hit hard- \\nest. As a result, some primary residency training posi- \\ntions were cut for 1995-1996. Future solutions may \\ninvolve funding directly through medical training \\ninstitutions.', 'tions were cut for 1995-1996. Future solutions may \\ninvolve funding directly through medical training \\ninstitutions. \\nThe session provoked considerable discussion. Issues \\nraised included: credit training programs for Ph.D. medical geneticists \\nas well as for clinical cytogeneticists, clinical molecular \\ngeneticists, and clinical biochemical geneticists. \\nRoss McLeod presented an overview of the develop- \\nment of Canadian genetics residency programs.

      "['1. Continue to work to improve medical genetics cov-\\nerage in the United States Medical Licensing Ex-amination (USMLE) and encourage the reporting ofa Step 1 genetics score to deans.']\n",
      "['2. Implement the association’s question database and\\nprovide access to participating institutions.']\n",
      "['3. Encourage the use and development of computer-\\nbased resources for human genetics teaching.']\n",
      "['The first step in developing a PBL case is establish-\\ning the learning objectives. The case scenario is thenwritten to bring out those objectives. Questions may beincluded to help direct the students toward the issuesof concern. Separate student and tutor guides are thendeveloped. The tutor guides provide background that isnecessary for tutors who are not experts in the prob-lem’s content area.\\nReviews of Medical Genetics Text Books\\nJoe Christian (Indiana University) described his ex-\\nperience using the Thompson and Thompson book[Thompson et al., 1991] for a medical student course.The book is somewhat out of date, but a new edition isexpected this year. The text is well written and read-able. It includes a reasonable amount of informationfor a medical student course in genetics, but the ap-proach is not as clinical as that taken by some otherbooks.\\nGreg Grabowski (University of Cincinnati) reviewed\\nthe Gelehrter and Collins book [1990]. This book isrelatively short but works well for genetics courses thatmust be taught in a limited amount of time. The text isreadable but lacks detail in some areas. The questionsare generally well focused.\\nMarian Rivas (University of Tennessee) discussed', 'Marian Rivas (University of Tennessee) discussed\\nthe Mueller, Young, and Emery [1995] and the Jorde,Carey, and White [1995] books. Both are recent (1995),but they take very different approaches to presentingthe material. The Emery et al. book uses a classicalapproach, presenting principles first and then the clini-cal applications. This separation of the normal and ab-normal aspects of a topic often seems artificial. Thebook does not include problems, but it is attractivelydesigned.\\nThe Jorde et al. book is more condensed and stresses\\nproblem-solving, genetic approaches to disease, andgenetic variation. Genetic themes are integratedthroughout the text rather than being presented onlyin one place. Topics such as cancer genetics, commondiseases, multifactorial inheritance, and mitochondrialgenetics are presented well, but other topics (e.g., de-velopmental genetics and pharmacogenetics) are notincluded at all.\\nCAI in Medical Genetics\\nBruce Dowton (Washington University) demon-', 'CAI in Medical Genetics\\nBruce Dowton (Washington University) demon-\\nstrated a prototype computer-assisted program he de-veloped for teaching medical genetics. The program isdesigned so that it can be used by students and train-ees at several different levels as well as for continuingeducation. The program takes into account the varyingbackground of both students and faculty with respectto genetics and computer literacy. The prototype,which is called ‘‘Tools for Teaching Genetics,’’ includescore concepts, skills, technologies, disease descriptions,and images as well as case studies and problem sets.These elements are assembled into an electronic text-book that can be viewed at varying levels of detail andincludes hypertext links to related concepts elsewherein the system. The software runs as a free-standingapplication on many different kinds of computers.Medical Genetics Question Bank\\nPeggy McGovern (Mt. Sinai) has assembled a data-\\nbase of medical genetics questions over the past year.Twenty-four member institutions of the Association ofProfessors have submitted some 9,000 questions(mostly multiple-choice) from medical student examsgiven over the past 3 years. These questions and theirassociated images have been scanned into a databaseand divided into 6 subject categories: general genetics,cytogenetics, biochemical genetics, molecular genetics,clinical genetics, and population genetics. Further sub-classification of the questions is planned.\\nDr. McGovern proposed that this database be used as', 'Dr. McGovern proposed that this database be used as\\nthe nucleus of an ongoing service that would be avail-able to members of the Association of Professors. Inorder to gain access to the questions, a member wouldsubmit 3 recent examinations and provide a certainnumber of additional questions each year. There wouldbe a one-time administrative fee and a smaller annualsubscription fee. The exact conditions for membershipwould be defined in consultation with the participants.The database would be distributed on disk to help pre-serve confidentiality. Mt. Sinai School of Medicine willserve as the coordinating center for this database.\\nSESSION 2: EMPOWERING GENETICS AS A\\nDISCIPLINE WITHIN MEDICAL SCHOOLS\\n(Jan Friedman, University of British Columbia,\\nChair; organized with Jewell Ward, University\\nof Tennessee)\\nReview of United States Medical Licensing\\nExamination (USMLE) Questions in\\nMedical Genetics\\nA delegation representing the Association of Profes-\\nsors and the American Society of Human Genetics(ASHG) visited the National Board of Medical Exam-iners on 4–5 December 1995 to review the genetics con-tent of the USMLE. The delegation consisted of JanFriedman (University of British Columbia), Skip Elsas(Emory University), Mimi Blitzer (University of Mary-land), and Maimon Cohen (University of Maryland).The delegates reviewed all of the questions and an-swers to the most recently administered editions of theUSMLE Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3 examinations. EachStep examination includes 720–730 multiple-choicequestions that had been administered over 2 days.', 'After reviewing the examinations, the delegates\\nmade both qualitative and quantitative observations.These include:']\n",
      "['1. Less than 5% of the items asked questions requiring\\nknowledge of genetics. Of these items, only aboutone third dealt with important genetic principles;the other items tested specific facts related to indi-vidual genetic conditions.']\n",
      "['was skewed, probably reflecting the structure of theTest Materials Development Committees that putitems on the examinations. Some areas were rea-sonably well covered. Other areas were coveredpoorly or not at all.']\n",
      "['4. Several items had ‘‘correct answers’’ that the del-\\negates considered to be wrong because current ge-netic understanding was ignored.']\n",
      "['5. A positive family history was included as extrane-\\nous information in some questions. There wereother instances in which the list of answers includedone or more genetic diseases as incorrect responses.']\n",
      "['6. There were many missed opportunities to test im-\\nportant genetic principles. This usually could havebeen achieved by changing just a few words in thequestion or responses. There were also several in-stances in which a question about microbial geneticscould have been made clinically relevant by askingthe question about human genetics instead.\\nAfter reviewing the USMLE test materials, the del-\\negation met with Dr. L. Thompson Bowles, President ofthe National Board of Medical Examiners, Dr. DonaldE. Melnick, Senior Vice President, and their seniorstaff who are responsible for the USMLE Step 1, Step2, and Step 3 examinations. The delegates discussedtheir findings and concerns about the genetics contentof the examinations.\\nThe delegates were disappointed to learn that there\\nare currently only 3 or 4 human geneticists on any ofthe USMLE Test Materials Development Committeesor Step Committees. The delegates believe that themedical genetics coverage of the USMLE could be im-proved substantially if more individuals with expertisein this area took part in writing, reviewing, and select-ing questions for the USMLE. The delegation, there-fore, urged the National Board of Medical Examiners toestablish a Medical Genetics Test Materials Develop-ment Committee and to appoint qualified medical ge-neticists to each of the Step Committees.\\nAs teachers of medical genetics, the delegates felt', 'As teachers of medical genetics, the delegates felt\\nthat it would be very useful for the USMLE to report agenetics subscore on the Step 1 examination to themedical school deans in the same way that subscores inother subject areas are reported. The officers and staffof the National Board of Medical Examiners receivedthese comments with great interest and will take therecommendations made to the various constituent com-mittees for consideration.\\n[This report has been approved for release by the Na-\\ntional Board of Medical Examiners. ]\\nImproving Clinical Genetics Research\\nJim Hanson (National Institute of Child Health and\\nHuman Development [NICHD]) reviewed how healthcare reform, in general, and Medicare reform, in par-ticular, threaten the financial foundations of academicmedical centers. Most genetic research sponsored bythe U.S. government is funded through the NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH). Less than one half of thisfunding goes to the National Center for Human Ge-nome Research. Other funds flow through various in-\\nstitutes including the NICHD, the National Cancer In-stitute (NCI), the National Institute of EnvironmentalHealth Sciences (NIEHS), and the National Institute ofGeneral Medical Sciences (NIGMS), among others.Most of the support goes to basic science research; onlya small amount is spent on clinical research. There isno coordination of clinical genetics research activitieseither within the NIH or between the NIH and otheragencies involved (e.g., the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention [CDC] and the Health Resources andServices Administration [HRSA]).', 'Since 1986, the NICHD has funded clinical research\\nnetworks. Such networks are currently in operation inthe fields of neonatology, perinatology, and pediatricpharmacology and drug development. These networksfunction as collaborative agreements between the NIHand academic clinical centers that are chosen competi-tively. Once established, the network identifies re-search problems, prioritizes them, and carries out ap-propriate studies. The networks have focused largelyon clinical trials, although some observational studiesand other investigations have been pursued. Dr. Han-son believes that the NICHD would consider the devel-opment of a clinical genetics network, although thevalue of such an enterprise would have to be veryclearly demonstrated.\\nCreating a Medical Genetics Department in the\\nAcademic Medical Center\\nKurt Hirschhorn (Mt. Sinai) discussed what is nec-\\nessary to create an academic medical genetics depart-ment in a center that does not currently have one. Thefactors include:']\n",
      "['1. High-quality funded research.']\n",
      "['2. Wide recognition of the need for a medical genetics\\ndepartment outside the medical genetics unit.']\n",
      "['3. Convincing the dean and university administration\\nthat excellence in medical genetics is important tothe future of the medical school as a whole.']\n",
      "['4. Building support for a medical genetics department\\namong the medical school department heads.']\n",
      "['5. Working out overlaps in research, teaching, and pa-\\ntient care.']\n",
      "['7p for thorough evaluations of any associated CNS ab-\\nnormalities.\\nGenital abnormalities were noted in 12 cases (39%)\\nand consisted mostly of genital hypoplasia. It appearsthat 7p includes genes that are necessary for normalgenital development. HOX genes, which specify devel-opmental boundaries and determine cell fate duringmorphogenesis have been linked to abnormal genitaldevelopment. Recently, the hand-foot-genital syn-drome was shown to result from a mutation in a HOXgene (HOXA13), which maps to 7p15-p14.2. The syn-drome affects the digital structures and can involveuterine anomalies in females and hypospadias of vari-able severity in males [Innis, 1997; Mortlock and Innis,1997].\\nEye abnormalities were seen in 11 cases (30%) and\\nconsisted mostly of mild microphthalmia and ptosis.Duane syndrome was documented for the first time inour patient. Recent data suggests that mutations in theBPES2 gene, which maps to 7p21-p13, cause blepharo-phimosis, epicanthus inversus, and ptosis [De Baere etal., 1999].\\nOther systemic abnormalities included choanal atre-\\nsia (13%), gastrointestinal malformations (13%), oralcleft (13%), and renal abnormalities (8%).\\nThe mortality associated with trisomy 7p is not in-\\nsignificant, and death in early infancy is seen in closeto one-third of cases. All of those who died had congen-ital malformations of the cardiovascular system. Fol-low-up data on surviving patients showed severe men-tal retardation in approximately 40% of cases and mildto moderate mental retardation in 17% of affected in-dividuals.', 'Although our patient is monosomic for 9p24, she did\\nnot have any of the manifestations of 9p deletion.These include trigonocephalic shape of head, an up-ward slant of the palpebral fissures, a long philtrum, ashort nose, and a webbed neck [Teebi et al., 1993].However she did have obesity, which was seen in one of\\nthe cases of 9p monosomy [Serra et al., 1997]. Her pre-dominant facial changes were consistent with trisomy7p — mostly the large fontanelle in early childhood,prominent forehead, and hypertelorism. Significant en-largement of the fontanelle is the most characteristicfinding of most patients with trisomy 7p. It has beenpostulated that duplications of the various segments of7p may hamper cranial vault ossification. In additionto obesity and depression, a new finding in our patientis hypothyroidism. Although caution must be exercisednot to generalize from one case, we recommend periodicmonitoring of thyroid function in individuals with tri-somy 7p.\\nFISH was essential in the certain identification of\\npartial trisomy 7p in the proposita and has permittedus to offer more accurate clinical information on thissyndrome to the parents. In addition, the long-termfollow-up allowed us to contribute toward a better un-derstanding of the natural history of this syndrome.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe thank the family S. for their cooperation and con-\\ntinuous support.\\nREFERENCES\\nBartoloni Saint Omer F, Calzolari A, Cecconi A, Giovannucci Uzielli ML.']\n",
